            <h2 class="secHeading">Adevnture Time!</h2>
            <p class="text"> Adventure is the experience of stepping out of your comfort zone and into the unknown,
                where curiosity meets excitement. It is about exploring new places, meeting unfamiliar faces, and
                embracing challenges that test both your courage and adaptability. From scaling mountains and diving
                into deep oceans to wandering through hidden city streets or trying something completely new, adventure
                comes in many forms. Its essence lies in the thrill of unpredictability and the joy of discovery, making
                each moment feel alive and unforgettable.
                <br> <br>
                Beyond the excitement, adventure also shapes personal growth. It pushes you to overcome fears, adapt to
                unexpected situations, and see the world from new perspectives. Every adventure—whether bold and
                adrenaline-filled or calm and reflective—leaves behind valuable lessons and cherished memories. It adds
                color, meaning, and a sense of wonder to life, reminding us that the best stories often begin when we
                dare to take that first step into the unknown.

                <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Biking is a blend of freedom, fitness, and fun, offering a way to explore the world on two
                wheels while keeping both body and mind active. It’s more than just a mode of transportation—it’s an
                experience that connects you with the surroundings in a way no car or bus ever could. Whether you’re
                cruising along quiet country roads, tackling rugged mountain trails, or weaving through busy city
                streets, biking gives you a sense of independence and adventure. The rhythmic motion of pedaling, the
                rush of wind against your face, and the satisfaction of covering miles with your own effort make it a
                uniquely rewarding activity.
                <br> <br>
                Beyond enjoyment, biking is an excellent workout that strengthens muscles, improves cardiovascular
                health, and boosts mental well-being. It’s eco-friendly, reducing your carbon footprint while also
                saving on fuel and transport costs. For some, biking is a sport; for others, it’s a daily commute, a
                weekend hobby, or even a form of meditation on wheels. No matter the style—road cycling, mountain
                biking, BMX, or leisurely rides biking offers a balance of adventure, fitness, and joy that keeps people
                coming back to the saddle time and again.

            <div class="bg bg2">
                <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is an exhilarating adventure sport that lets you experience the sensation of
                flying freely through the sky with nothing but a fabric wing above and the open air around you. Using
                wind currents and thermal lifts, a paraglider can soar gracefully for minutes or even hours, gliding
                over mountains, valleys, rivers, and coastlines while enjoying panoramic views that few ever get to see.
                The take-off—usually from a hillside or mountain slope—quickly transforms nerves into pure thrill as
                your feet lift off the ground and you drift weightlessly, guided by the breeze.
                <br> <br>
                Beyond the adrenaline rush, paragliding offers a unique sense of peace and connection with nature. The
                world below appears calm and distant, and every turn or lift feels like a dance with the wind. While it
                requires proper training, safety gear, and favorable weather conditions, it’s suitable for both
                beginners and experienced flyers through tandem flights or solo adventures. Paragliding is not just a
                sport—it’s a blend of thrill, beauty, and serenity that leaves you with unforgettable memories and a
                newfound appreciation for the sky.

            <div class="bg bg3">
                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is an exciting water sport that blends athletic skill with a deep connection to the
                ocean. It involves riding waves on a surfboard, using balance, timing, and technique to glide smoothly
                across the water’s surface. From the moment you paddle out through the rolling waves to the exhilarating
                rush of catching one and riding it toward the shore, surfing delivers a unique mix of adrenaline and
                freedom. Each wave is different, making every ride a fresh challenge and an opportunity to improve your
                skills.
                <br> <br>
                Beyond the thrill, surfing is also about rhythm, patience, and harmony with nature. Surfers often
                describe it as a form of meditation in motion—waiting for the perfect wave, feeling the ocean’s power,
                and moving in sync with it. It’s a full-body workout that builds strength, endurance, and flexibility
                while also boosting mental well-being. Whether you’re tackling giant breaks in Hawaii, gentle swells in
                Bali, or small local beach waves, surfing offers a lifestyle of adventure, relaxation, and respect for
                the sea.
